Implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices involves several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Below is a detailed explanation of each step using Python.

1. Data Collection
You need a dataset that contains features (independent variables) and target values (house prices). A popular dataset for this purpose is the Boston Housing Dataset, but you can also use other datasets like the Kaggle Housing Prices dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing your data for the model. Here are the common steps:

Loading Data: Load your dataset using pandas.

Handling Missing Values: Check for and handle missing values. You can impute them or drop rows/columns with missing data.

Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for the model.

Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features if necessary.

Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training
Use a library like scikit-learn to create and train the linear regression model.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
